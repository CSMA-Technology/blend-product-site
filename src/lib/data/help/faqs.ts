    question: 'Can I use Blend on my iPad?',
    answer: `<p>Yes! Blend is available on all web browsers, and it works great on a tablet. Simply go to  <a href="https://app.blendreading.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">app.blendreading.com</a> on your device and the app will work. We love using Playlists on an iPad!</p><p>  However, we do not recommend using Blend on any device smaller than a tablet. The app will work on mobile devices, but we can’t guarantee that the interface will display properly.</p><p> The recommended screen size for Blend is 1024x768 or larger.</p>`,
