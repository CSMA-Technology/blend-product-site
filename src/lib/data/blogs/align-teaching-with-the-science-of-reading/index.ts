Given that the science of reading encompasses many different components of teaching and learning to achieve the goal of literacy in children, it can be very overwhelming for teachers to get started in changing their lessons to use the techniques outlined in the methodology.`,

There’s a lot more to it than what we’ll talk about here, and there are lots of courses and certifications that you can take to delve into the entire approach, but what it really breaks down to is five pillars that scientists believe are the key to building literacy in children. `,

      skill of decoding the words, rather than memorizing them by sound or sight. You can even encourage them to slide
      their finger under the word as they sound it out – this is a great practice especially for younger students!`,

      This is where a blending board can come in handy, allowing you to focus on phonemic awareness and morphology through which your students can
